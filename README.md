# Datar-Gionis-Indyk-Motwani-DGIM-Algorithm

The Datar-Gionis-Indyk-Motwani (DGIM) Algorithm is a well-known algorithm for approximately counting the number of 1s in a sliding window of a binary stream. It is particularly useful in scenarios where exact counting is infeasible due to memory or computational constraints. The DGIM algorithm provides an efficient way to estimate the count with a bounded error.
