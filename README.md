# Datar-Gionis-Indyk-Motwani-DGIM-Algorithm

The Datar-Gionis-Indyk-Motwani (DGIM) Algorithm is a well-known algorithm for approximately counting the number of 1s in a sliding window of a binary stream. It is particularly useful in scenarios where exact counting is infeasible due to memory or computational constraints. The DGIM algorithm provides an efficient way to estimate the count with a bounded error.
## Applications of Counting 1s in Data Streams (Using DGIM Algorithm)
 1. Network Traffic Monitoring

Counting the number of packets (1s) in a fixed time window to detect anomalies or DDoS attacks.

2. Social Media Trend Analysis

Tracking the frequency of hashtags or keywords in real-time streams (e.g., Twitter trends).

3. Log File Analysis

Counting occurrences of specific error codes in server logs over a sliding window.

4. Sensor Data Processing

Monitoring the frequency of certain events (e.g., high-temperature readings) in IoT sensor streams.

5. Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

Detecting sudden spikes in transactions (1s represent flagged transactions).

##Explanation
1. Buckets Structure

Buckets keep track of 1s in exponentially increasing sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).

Each bucket stores the timestamp of the most recent 1 in its range.

2. Merging Buckets

If a bucket has more than two entries, the oldest two are merged into a higher-level bucket.

3. Sliding Window Maintenance

Old entries (outside the window) are removed to keep the count relevant.

4. Counting 1s

The estimated count sums the sizes of all buckets, adjusting for partial overage of the oldest bucket.

##Advantages of DGIM
Memory Efficient: Uses O(log N) space.

Fast Updates: Each new bit is processed in O(log N) time.

Bounded Error: The estimated count is at least true count - 50%.

This implementation is useful for real-time stream processing where exact counting is impractical. Adjust window_size based on your application's needs.
